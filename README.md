# ASP\.NET Boilerplate Tutorials
This is a set of tutorials I've created for my junior team using [ASP\.NET Boilerplate](https://www.aspnetboilerplate.com). Specifically ASP\.NET Boilerplate using ASP\.NET Core running on \.NET Core with the Angular 2 SPA.

## Prerequisites Tools
* Visual Studio 2017
* VSCode
* NodeJS

## Prerequisite Understanding
### \.NET Core
\.NET Core can be thought of as a cross-platform version of the \.NET Framework supporting Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used in device, cloud, and embedded/IoT scenarios. It implements the \.NET Standard Library specification.

### ASP\.NET Core
ASP\.NET Core is no longer based on __System.Web.dll__
ASP\.NET Core apps can run on \.NET Core or on the full \.NET Framework

### Entity Framework Core
The technology formerly known as Entity Framework 7 (EF7) was renamed to Entity Framework Core (EF Core) in early 2016 but can run on the full \.NET Framework or on \.NET Core.

### Angular
Angular is an open-source frontend web application platform
