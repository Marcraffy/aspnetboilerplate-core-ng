# Adding Email Verification using SendGrid

ASP\.NET Boilerplate (at time of writing) does not include email verification when a user registers (it is available in the paid-for version ASP\.NET Zero).

This is a perfect opportunity to dive into ABP and understand how it's put together by adding our own email verification.

This exercise is for ASP\.NET Boilerplate Core & Angular.
